<p id="description">This project focuses on analyzing transactional data from an online retailer based in the UK covering the period from 2010 to 2011. The main goal is to enhance marketing strategies and increase sales by segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior. To achieve this the data is transformed into a customer-centric dataset by creating new features. Then the K-means clustering algorithm is applied to group customers into distinct segments. These segments help in understanding the unique profiles and preferences of different customer groups. Additionally a recommendation system is developed to suggest top-selling products to customers within each segment who haven't purchased those items yet. Overall the project aims to optimize marketing efficiency and boost sales by providing personalized product recommendations to customers.</p>
